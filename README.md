# HW_06_APIs

This homework was comprised of two different parts. The first part utilized a weather API to retrieve current weather data for a number of random cities. The data was then transformed into summary graphs for easier data interpretation.

The second part of the homework utilized map and geography APIs to create maps and pull relevant geographic information (such as nearest landmarks).
